            <li style="text-align: left">
              Hangman is a classic word guessing game that can be played with
              two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other
              player(s) try to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a
              time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a "hangman" is drawn,
              typically with a gallows and a stick figure being hanged. The game
              ends either when the word is guessed correctly or the "hangman" is
              completed. In a single-player version of the game, the computer
              chooses a random word and displays a row of dashes to represent
              the letters in the word. The player then tries to guess the word
              by suggesting letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word,
              the computer replaces the corresponding dash(es) with the letter.
              If the letter is not in the word, the computer adds a part to the
              hangman. The player continues to guess letters until either the
              word is correctly guessed or the hangman is completed. The game
              can be made more challenging by restricting the number of guesses
              allowed before the hangman is completed. The number of incorrect
              guesses allowed varies, but a common number is six, which
              corresponds to the number of parts typically drawn for the hangman
              (head, body, two arms, and two legs).
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              This is an extended version of the game which increase the number
              of lives from six to ten, allowing the player more chances to
              guess the word before the game ends. With ten lives, the player
              would have to make ten incorrect guesses before the hangman is
              completed and the game ends. This would make the game more
              forgiving and give the player more opportunities to guess the word
              correctly, but could also make the game last longer and
              potentially more challenging as the player may have to guess more
              letters to solve the word. Additionally, increasing the number of
              lives could encourage the player to take more risks with their
              guesses, potentially leading to more exciting and unpredictable
              gameplay.

          <h3 style="text-align: left">Technical Details:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>startGame():</strong> is used to start a new game. The
              function sets the lives and counter variables to 10 and 0,
              respectively. It then calls clearGrid() function to clear the game
              board. After that, the function calls getAPIWord() which is a
              promise-based function that fetches a word from an API. Once the
              promise is resolved, the my_word variable is assigned the returned
              value from the API call. Next, the function calls
              generateWordGrid() which generates the game board based on the
              length of the my_word variable. It then calls generateKeyboard()
              which generates the keyboard for the user to input their guesses.
              Finally, the function updates the src attribute of the image with
              an id of hangmanPicture to display the starting image of a full
              hangman (10.png).
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>clearGrid():</strong> function that is used to clear the
              game board whenever a new game is started. The function clears the
              previous word and keyboard by removing all child nodes from their
              respective parent elements. It first retrieves the la_wordy
              element and el_keyboard element using document.getElementById().
              Then, it uses a while loop to remove all child nodes from these
              elements until none are left. Finally, it retrieves the
              main_button element using document.getElementById() and removes
              all of its child nodes using another while loop.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>generateWordGrid():</strong> This function generates a
              grid of spaces for each letter in the word. It uses the my_word
              variable, which is the randomly generated word retrieved from an
              API in the startGame() function. For each letter in the word, a
              button element is created and given an id attribute that matches
              the letter it represents. The innerHTML of each button is set to
              an underscore ("_"), representing a blank space for the letter to
              be guessed. Finally, each button element is appended to the grid
              element, which is an HTML element with an id of "la_wordy".
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>generateKeyboard():</strong> This function generates a
              conventional keyboard by creating an HTML element for each button
              in the keyboard. The letters in the keyboard are represented in
              three arrays, one array per row. First, the function accesses the
              keyboard space by getting the element with the "el_keyboard" id.
              Then, the function creates a div element to contain the entire
              keyboard grid and sets its attributes. The function then iterates
              through each row of the keyboard. For each row, the function
              creates a div element to contain the row and sets its attributes.
              Then, the function retrieves the array of letters for the current
              row and iterates through each letter in the row. For each letter
              in the row, the function creates a button element, sets its
              attributes (class, type, id, and onclick), and adds the letter to
              the innerHTML of the button element. The id attribute of the
              button is set to the current letter, which is later used to
              identify the button when the user clicks on it. Finally, the
              button element is added to the current row, and the row is added
              to the keyboard grid. The keyboard grid is then added to the
              keyboard space element.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>letterAttempt():</strong> function responsible for
              checking whether the letter clicked by the player exists in the
              target word or not. If the letter exists, it is displayed in the
              appropriate position(s) of the target word. Otherwise, a life is
              reduced. The function takes in a parameter letter, which is the
              letter clicked by the player. The function first gets a reference
              to the button element that corresponds to the clicked letter using
              its id. It then sets the class of this button to "btn btn-success
              disabled" to indicate that the letter has been attempted. Next, it
              initializes a boolean flag flag to false to keep track of whether
              the letter exists in the target word or not. It also converts the
              letter parameter to lowercase and gets a reference to the element
              that contains the target word using its id. It then gets an array
              of all the letter elements that make up the target word. The
              function then iterates through the letter elements of the target
              word and checks whether the id of each letter element matches the
              lowercase letter parameter. If there is a match, it sets the
              innerHTML of the letter element to the uppercase letter, sets the
              flag variable to true, and increments the counter variable that
              keeps track of the number of correct attempts. If there is no
              match, the reduceLife() function is called to reduce a life.
              Finally, the function checks whether the player has won the game
              by comparing the counter variable to the length of the target
              word. If the counter is equal to the length of the target word,
              the wonGame() function is called.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>reduceLife():</strong> This function reduces the number of
              lives left in the game by one and updates the hangman picture
              accordingly. It first decrements the value of the lives variable
              and then updates the image source of the hangman picture to
              display the corresponding image for the current number of lives
              left. If there are no more lives left (i.e., lives < 1), the
              hangman picture is updated to the final image and the endGame()
              function is called to end the game. Otherwise, the function
              updates the image source to display the picture for the current
              number of lives left. The photoSources object is a mapping between
              the number of lives left and the corresponding image file name. It
              is used to easily update the image source based on the number of
              lives left.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>endGame():</strong> This function is called when the
              player has run out of lives, and it displays the word that the
              player was trying to guess. The function first clears the grid,
              which removes the letter buttons and the keyboard. It then creates
              a heading element that says "Game Over! the word was:". Next, it
              iterates through each letter of the word and creates a new button
              element for each letter. Each button is given the class "btn
              btn-success" and is assigned an id that matches the letter it
              represents. The letter is then added as the text content of the
              button, and the button is added to the grid. Finally, the function
              creates a "Play Again" button and adds it to the "main_button"
              element. The button has the class "btn btn-outline-success btn-lg"
              and an onclick attribute that calls the startGame() function.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              The <strong>wonGame()</strong> function is called when the player
              has successfully guessed all the letters of the word. This
              function performs the following steps:
              <ol>
                <li style="text-align: left">
                  Clears the grid where the word and keyboard were displayed.
                </li>
                <li style="text-align: left">
                  Adds a header to inform the player that they have won.
                </li>
                <li style="text-align: left">
                  Iterates through the word and creates a button for each letter
                  to display the word. Adds a "PLAY AGAIN" button to restart the
                  game.
                </li>
                <li style="text-align: left">
                  Displays an image of "WIN" to indicate the player has won.
                </li>
              </ol>
              Overall, the wonGame() function performs similar actions to the
              endGame() function, but with different messaging and images based
              on whether the player has won or lost the game.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: left">
              <strong>getAPIWord():</strong> fucntion that uses the fetch method
              to retrieve a random word from the API at API_URL. The response is
              then converted to JSON format, and the first word in the resulting
              array is assigned to the global variable api_word. This word is
              also added to the name attribute of an HTML element with
              id="la_wordy". Finally, the function logs the word to the console
              and returns it. Note that this function is dependent on an
              external API and will only work if the API is accessible and
              returns data in the expected format.
